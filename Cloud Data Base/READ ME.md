This is a project to create a multithreading cloud database. A client and server script is written as backend for a TCP handshake to 
occur allowing end user to upload customers to the database. 
 
The client is allowed to enter full name, phone number, address, and a picture file. Features were designed to allow the user to download the entire database,
 upload a database, download just a photo from a specific customer, and more. A menu was created to allow the user to keep track of everything. 


NOTE: This is written using python 3 in VS code.
WARNING: Keeping pictures to upload in the same directory as the script(s) is suggested or an error in the program is thrown.
